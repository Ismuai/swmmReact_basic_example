# Intro to creating web apps with swmmReact

Creating web apps with swmmReact is simple. Developing environmental models and showing them off is easy with swmmReact. You can have people open your files, work with current versions, read results, focus on what you want them to focus on, add maps, and make responsive, interactive systems. swmmReact can help people feel engaged with your data, showing models and model results that abstract away finer details that may interfere in communicating

## About this example

This particular example is made for those that are very new to web programming. By the time you have completed this example, you will have a working web page that you can display the results of a running model on your own computer. You can then upload those files to a web server, or simply make a web page on Github and move on from there.

# Setting up your computer for development

You won't need to do a lot of work to start programming with swmmReact. While you'll be working with Node.js, npm, React, and Github desktop, there's really only 2 programs that you will install in this example: Node.js and Github desktop. Of course I'll walk you through each one:

## Node.js

Node.jsÂ® (https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. Javascript has often been associated with programming for web browsers, but Node.js allows you to do all kinds of cool desktop and server-side programming that used to belong squarely in the domain of php, python, perl, and plenty of programming paradigms that probably aren't prepended with 'P'. JavaScript is different because it starts with a 'J'. Check out some of the other differences here: (https://nodejs.org/en/about/).

## Github Desktop

Github Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/) isn't the only way or the best way to interact with Github, but it is a colorful GUI with plenty of fun buttons to push, and that's what's really important. You'll need to sign up for a Github account (https://github.com/) but they make the process as painless as possible.

## npm

npm (https://www.npmjs.com/) stands for Node Package Manager, and believe it or not, you already installed it. To make sure I'm not lying to you, open up a command prompt (search cmd in your desktop's search widget) and type npm -v. That will give you the version number of your current npm install. One last thing: their website will ask you to create an account or subscribe to the pro version. If you're into that sort of thing, don't let me stop you, but you really don't need to.

## React

React (https://reactjs.org/) is an amazingly easy and fun programming system based upon JavaScript. React allows you to create websites incredibly quickly, and really one of the best ways to get acquanted with it is 'create-react-app'. Once you are done with this tutorial, it would be a good idea to check out how easy it is to use create-react-app to make simple (or complex) web apps. There are no puns in this section.
